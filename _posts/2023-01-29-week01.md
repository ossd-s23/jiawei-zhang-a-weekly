I am thrilled to have the opportunity to meet all of the wonderful professor and students. The history of open source development truly impresses me, and I am deeply moved by the dedication, compassion, and selfless contributions of individuals like Richard Stallman (RMS) to the open source community. This is the first time I have encountered the term OSSD and have learned about licenses and how they can be used to protect the authors and even generate revenue from "free" software.
