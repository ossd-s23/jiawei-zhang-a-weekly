# Open-Source in Healthcare


As a student who is also passionate about healthcare, I have did an observational study on MBQIP biatric surgery, which is also related to diabete and is also open source [link here](https://jiawei-zhang.top/projects/4_project/). As my research is only for biostatistics and not for patients. The presentation left a lasting impression on me, prompting me to reflect on the bigger scale of importance of open source in the healthcare industry and its potential to transform the way we approach patient care.

Christopher Snider's presentation demonstrated the power of open-source technology in empowering patients. With access to their own health data through platforms like Tidepool, patients can gain a better understanding of their condition, leading to more informed decisions about their care. This level of patient engagement is something that should be encouraged and celebrated, as it can ultimately lead to better health outcomes.

During my oberservational study, I have been benefited from such kinds of open source spirit. The machine learning approaches, healthcare code and the MBQIP data are all free and easily acessible for a student like me. So we can see how a researcher and patients benefits from OSSD and how they are all making the healthcare industry a better place.

# Progress on scikit-learn

We are not facing any too big chaleedges, as all things are smooth and we are consitently contributing. I have made 10 PRs and 8 have been acceptted. 2 very complex PR are still waiting to be reviewed. The PR can be found below
