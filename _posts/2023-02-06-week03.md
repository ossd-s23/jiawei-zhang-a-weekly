# Git Review

<!--more-->
The Process of git activity to a OSSD:
1. Fork the repo
2. Clone to the local machine
3. Keep a connection to the original repository that one forked, so that one has access to the changes made in that repository.

<code>git remote add upstream URL</code>
<code>git remote -v</code>

4. Add, commit and push to the origin

<code>git push origin main</code>

5. Get the latest updates from the remote and deal with the confliction. This process will include automatic commit.

<code>git pull upstream master

git config pull.rebase false  # merge

git config pull.rebase true   # rebase

git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only

</code>

6. Repeat the steps from the previous step

7. Raise a Pull Request if finally contribute to the Upstream


# Rebase

The difference between git pull rebase false and git pull rebase true lies in how Git integrates changes from a remote repository into the local branch.

When git pull rebase false is used, the changes from the remote repository are integrated into the local branch as a new commit. This results in a new branch structure with additional commit(s) on top of the current branch, creating a new line of development.

On the other hand, git pull rebase true uses rebasing to integrate changes from the remote repository into the local branch. In rebasing, the local branch's changes are reapplied on top of the updated remote branch, effectively integrating the remote changes and rewriting the branch's history. The end result is a linear branch history with no additional commit(s).

Note: Be cautious when using git pull rebase true as rebasing can cause conflicts and rewrite Git history, which can lead to potential problems if other people are using the same branch.
