# PR Accepted!

I am thrilled that four of my pull requests have been accepted and proud to have the 'contributor' badge whenever I join discussions on scikit-learn issues. It may not be a major maintenance task, but it's a good start.

One thing I would like to express my complain about is that the organization of scikit-learn seems quite loose, with only few members occasionally reviewing pull requests with bigger features or longer codes. My first completed pull request, which followed their requirements and was assigned, has been waiting in the pull request pool for almost two weeks. Despite trying to @ the member and discuss the request, it seems to be a long journey to the final review stage. However, Charlie has given us hope by stating that once the reviewing process begins, it is fast. I hope they start reviewing it soon.

Here is the [PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26077) and the code `@validate_params(
    {
        "X": ["array-like", "sparse matrix"],
        "axis": [Options(Integral, {0, 1})],
        "copy": ["boolean"],
    }
)`
