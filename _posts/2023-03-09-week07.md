# Sklearn

We have chosen to work on Sklearn, although it was not an easy decision between Sklearn and pandas, as both are similar Python packages. After reading issues and community discussions, we found that Sklearn's community is more welcoming and in need of new features, which is exactly what we are looking for.

Our team has high hopes for this project and aims to make meaningful contributions, such as developing new features. It is exhilarating to consider contributing to such a well-known and widely-used project.

However, we also acknowledge that there are some worries and challenges associated with this project. To be able to contribute effectively, we need to have a solid understanding of various machine learning terminologies, such as random forest, data imputation, KNN, regression, classification, and preprocessing. We need to have a good grasp of the implementation details of these algorithms, which presents a significant challenge. Despite this, we are excited to take on this challenge and learn as much as we can to make meaningful contributions to the Sklearn community.
