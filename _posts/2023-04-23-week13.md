# The Inspiring World of Open Source Business Models

As someone who is constantly amazed by the versatility and potential of open source projects, I find it incredibly inspiring to learn about the various ways these projects can generate revenue within the industry. Be it open core, subscription-based, or dual licensing, each business model presents its unique advantages and opportunities for growth.

This fascination with open source has fueled my desire to start my own company someday, and I am more convinced than ever that embracing an open-source philosophy will be the cornerstone of my future venture. Discovering the numerous patterns and possibilities that exist within the open-source realm has truly opened my eyes to the potential for success.

A particularly striking example of this potential is MongoDB that I had always assumed was solely the product of passionate tech enthusiasts offering it for free. Imagine my surprise when I learned that MongoDB actually generated $1.28 billion in revenue! This revelation demonstrated to me the incredible potential for open source projects to thrive in the industry and the diverse range of business models available to support them.

I look forward to embracing the open-source spirit in my own entrepreneurial journey and combine it with open source business model.

# Inactive Maintainers and Revolutionary Implementations - Sklearn

One of the frustrating aspects of contributing to open source projects can be dealing with inactive maintainers. It can be disheartening when we put in the effort to develop an entire framework, complete with suggestions, code, tests, documentation, and proof, only to have our contributions go unreviewed. It is particularly aggravating when maintainers leave a single comment and then seemingly disappear, leaving our hard work in limbo.

Despite these challenges, we are engaged in developing a substantial pull request to implement `BayesSearchCV`. This innovative approach has the potential to greatly benefit the machine learning community by providing a more efficient method for parameter tuning compared to the traditionally used `GridSearch`.

Numerous research papers have demonstrated the efficiency and advantages of `BayesSearchCV` over `GridSearch`, indicating its potential to revolutionize the field. While the obstacles we face in open source contributions can be disheartening at times, it is the excitement of working on groundbreaking advancements like these that keep us motivated and passionate about our contributions.
