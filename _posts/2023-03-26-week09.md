# Sklearn

As a student, I never thought I'd be able to contribute to such a large project as Scikit-learn. But during this Spring Break, I was inspired by my teammate Charlie Xiao, who had already made a pull request, got it approved, and contributed to Scikit-learn. It motivated me to try my hand at contributing too.

Setting up the environment for contributing to Scikit-learn was  easy compared to other environments like Linux. However, I ran into some strange problems on my M2 chip. Luckily, I was able to fix them after fixing my conda

Finally, I found an issue that was interesting and suitable for me to tackle - adding a new parameter to FeatureUnion. I asked to be assigned to the issue and waited several days for a reply. When I was assigned by the GitHub bot to the issue, I immediately started working on it.

My work involves adding tests and writing functions for the new parameter verbose_feature_names_out to FeatureUnion. I am excited to be contributing to such an important project. It is amazing to see how quickly the community responds to my contribution, and how much it is appreciated.

In conclusion, contributing to Scikit-learn has been an exciting experience and I'm thrilled to make my first pull request. It's been a great opportunity to learn and grow as a developer, and I look forward to contributing more in the future.
