# Git Review

<!--more-->
The Process of git activity to a OSSD: 
1. Fork the repo
2. Clone to the local machine
3. Keep a connection to the original repository that one forked, so that one has access to the changes made in that repository.

```
git remote add upstream URL

git remote -v

```

4. Add, commit and push to the origin

```
git push origin main
```

5. Get the latest updates from the remote and deal with the confliction. This process will include automatic commit.

```
git pull upstream master

git config pull.rebase false  # merge

git config pull.rebase true   # rebase

git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
```


6. Repeat the steps from the previous step

7. Raise a Pull Request if finally contribute to the Upstream


# Rebase
\
The difference between git pull rebase false and git pull rebase true lies in how Git integrates changes from a remote repository into the local branch.
\
When git pull rebase false is used, the changes from the remote repository are integrated into the local branch as a new commit. This results in a new branch structure with additional commit(s) on top of the current branch, creating a new line of development.

\
On the other hand, git pull rebase true uses rebasing to integrate changes from the remote repository into the local branch. In rebasing, the local branch's changes are reapplied on top of the updated remote branch, effectively integrating the remote changes and rewriting the branch's history. The end result is a linear branch history with no additional commit(s).

\
Note: Be cautious when using git pull rebase true as rebasing can cause conflicts and rewrite Git history, which can lead to potential problems if other people are using the same branch.

# Add-on extension development reflection
I have learned a great deal about the challenges and rewards of working on an open-source project. Collaborating with other students is an entertaining and wonderful experience. We could all grow together.
\
Building the RateMyProfessor search add-on extension has been a journey filled with learning opportunities. I can gain hands-on experience in developing browser extensions, as well as a deeper understanding of git. 
\
One of the most satisfying aspects of this project has been seeing our work may really contribute to the NYU community. 
\
Overall, working on this project has been an incredible experience that has allowed me to grow both personally and professionally. I am grateful for the opportunity to develop my own open source project.
