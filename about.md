As a senior computer science major at NYU and a full-stack developer, I have a strong foundation in CS. In my free time, I indulge my passions for art, music, and architecture, with a special interest in R&B. I also enjoy playing the guitar and have had the opportunity to intern at Tencent Music for half a year. As an avid snowboarder, I enjoy hitting the slopes in my free time.
